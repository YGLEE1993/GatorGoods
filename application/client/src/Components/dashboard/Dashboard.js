/**
 * File name: Dashboard.js
 * Purpose: This is the dashboard view for users. It is unique to each user, and offers the ability for users to view,
 *          delete, or edit (not currently implemented) their listings. It also offers a table for easy viewing of
 *          interested parties' messages. This view is locked behind a validation check, ensuring that users who are
 *          not logged in cannot access it.

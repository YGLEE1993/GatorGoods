 * File name: authController.js
 * Purpose: This is the controller where we make all the queries related to logging in, logging out, registering, and
 *          authenticating users. Depending on whether a registered user is logged-in or logged-out will either enable
 *          or block access to user-specific views e.g. Dashboard.js, NewListing.js. Additionally, this is where we
 *          protect user passwords by encrypting them prior to placing into the db.
